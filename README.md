Cryptography engine

IN PROGRESS

History of the CyF project:
When I was little, I used to read the Encyclopedia Britannica.
I used to look up information about brownies, the human body,
and number theory. One time I stumbled upon cryptography.
Cryptography was fascinating because I learned I could create
secret messages. More than anything, I was learning and doing
no other kids my age did.

As a programmer, I needed to create projects with the skills I
was learning. The I remembered a cryptography square in the
encyclopedia and how much I enjoyed working with it back then.

This is how CyF was born.
